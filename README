Project description:
In this project, I implemented god mode where the player will not die. The project also now features music
and a restart option. We can press R and the game will restart. More importantly,
the project reaches a conclusion. You will win once you have accrued 100 Points
by shooting the crabs and you will lose if you lose all 3 lives.

Problems that I had in completing this project:
I always had trouble making the video in the lab but I resulted to using F4.
